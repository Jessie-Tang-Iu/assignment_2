# Software Security - Assignment 2

rewrite this application to incorporate the following:
•	Provide whitelist-style input validation for the data entered for each computer managed by the system
•	Rewrite the Computer, Desktop and Laptop classes to make them immutable. You will need to rewrite other code in the application once this is done to allow the main part of the program to use the revised classes
•	Rewrite the Desktop and Laptop to use composition instead of inheritance to reuse/incorporate the existing functionality of the Computer class. The Desktop and Laptop classes must not themselves directly manage any data that the Computer class holds, e.g. CPU, RAM, Disk attribute values

# Task To Be Done
1. Make Computer Class Immutable
2. Make Desktop Class Immutable
3. Make Laptop Class Immutable
4. Rewrite editComputer() Method (based on the immutable classes in task 1-3)
5. Implement Composition
6. Update ArrayList and Related Methods (based on implementation of composition)
7. Add Whitelist Input Validation
